# dotfiles

A crash of my dotfiles.

You'll likely find the most valuable stuff to crib from in [rc.d](/rc.d/). The
rest is mostly just weird garbage.

## Running

Invoke [ansible-run.sh](ansible-run.sh) to bootstrap and run the playbooks.

## Terminal Colorscheme
I use
[solarized](https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized) as
my main color scheme. I've borrowed @tomislav's and modified it to use hasklig
as the font.
